freenect (0.1)
======================================
pure data external to control Kinect tilt, led and output accelerometer data.
useful if you use OpenNI with SensorKinect (eg. pix_openni) which currently can't access these functions.

* depends on libfreenect (v0.1 !!)

Tested with 1 Kinects, but should work with multiple
